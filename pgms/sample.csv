fiftytwo tracks deep this archival compendium might seem like a catchall in fact it’s a chance to peek under the hood of the multiinstrumentalist’s creative process sam gendel plays both guitar and saxophone with a sneaky virtuosity his saxophone is often heavily modulated and his guitar attack is more like a tiptoe even his singing is hushed and mumbling and while it might sometimes sound like he’s filtering ideas through an old casio keyboard gendel has a sincere fascination with melody and rhythm—you might hear him suddenly break into an earnest beatbox that’s more like a jazz drummer recording a scratch track in just a few years he’s built a reputation out of creatively hungry experiments and collaborations across his last two albums alone he’s revamped songbook standards covered “old town road” on a german synthesizer and produced some gorgeously glitchy beats throw a dart at gendel’s discography and you might land on something that sounds like wayout free jazz or steamy rb gendel’s latest album fresh bread is a catchall collection of songs he recorded between  and  it’s not just a lot of music it’s a haphazard jumble some of the  tracks contained here are public performances and some are home recordings there’s free improv and fuzzy cloud rap solo performances and ensemble collaborations in its full version fresh bread feels more like a personal archive than an album but gendel has also pared the tracklist down to just under  songs for a vinyl edition it’s tempting to wonder if he would have been better off editing down the digital version too but all of these recordings really do deserve the light of day where to start “roomba” reminded me of an ocarina of time song the type of videogame moment where the chiptune production undersells its emotional gravity in gendel’s case a simple loop of saxophone guitar and drums turns meditative and trancelike until a solo soars near the end the production might sound a little cheap at first but it lays bare the beauty of the melody other tracks are less tinny and more spiritually open over the freejazz groove of “sometimes i feel so good” gendel euphorically singshouts the track’s title where some of his ideas require some coaxing out this is immediate and cathartic there are slow swells of ambient “wwaasshh” solo sax experiments “transparent background” and songs that feel like outtakes from other gendel albums the guitardriven “fractl” would have been right at home on his fulllength debut  not all of these ideas quite stand on their own merit the ambient noodling of “birds of paradise” track number  and “tape tiger” track number  feels untethered and nonessential more than three hours into the album gendel’s confident and fluid rapping on “champs élysées” might sneak up on you but his vocal performance is almost buried in the mix to the point of obscuring all the lyrics this much music can understandably trigger an i’lljustsiftthroughit defense mechanism to gendel’s credit fresh bread both resists and rewards that approach the music might run the gamut but the tracks are often loosely bunched together—you still get some jarring transitions but not at every turn more importantly as disconnected as they may be for the most part these aren’t halfbaked or unfinished drafts they’re thorough explorations of singular ideas what might appear at first like a harddrive dump turns out to be more like an exhibition in an art gallery how you navigate the space is up to you catch up every saturday with  of our bestreviewed albums of the week sign up for the  to hear newsletter here,9
